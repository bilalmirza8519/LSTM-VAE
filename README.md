# LSTM-VAE
Unsupervised Deep Learning for Multi-Omics

This is a keras code for LSTM-based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE). LSTM-VAE was employed to extract 
low-dimensional embeddings from time-series multi-omics data. The embeddings were fed to K-means 
clustering algorithm to group molecules based on their temporal patterns. Please refer to the figure LSTM-VAE.jpg
